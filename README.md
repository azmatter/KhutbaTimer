# KhutbaTimer
Android App which displays a countdown timer for the Khutba during Friday prayers.

KhutbaTimer will automatically pull in the week's Friday prayer times from the [Raleigh mosque website](http://raleighmasjid.org).
It will then use those times to automatically turn on a 30 minute timer at the start of the Khutba.
